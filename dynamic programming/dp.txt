Dynamic Progrmming

Approach:

Recursion -> Memoization (top down) -> tabulation (bottom up ) -> exclude extra space

Memoization

-> Initialize dp array/map with -1 
-> before Function call check whether it has already been completed
-> Before returning store it in dp array

Tabulation 
-> Declare dp array
-> Try to put base case in dp array
-instead of recursion we will use iteration
